# Work guidelines

Here is a guide on how to organize the team work. In the [Documentation](#documentation) section you can find a share resources for everyone to study and learn.

## Documentation

- [Python packages](https://dev.to/codemouse92/dead-simple-python-project-structure-and-imports-38c6) to use modules in the project

## Tasks

No work is going to be pushed to main directly. Each task we develope should be done in a separate branch and reviewed by the others in order to merge it.

We'll have 3 sections for the tasks: **TODO, IN PROGRESS, DONE**. Each new task goes into **TODO** section. Once someone picks a task, it should be assigned to it. When that person starts working on the task, it should be moved into **IN PROGRESS** section. And of course once the task is finished (when it is merged into main branch), it should be moved into **DONE** section.

### TODO

### IN PROGRESS

### DONE
